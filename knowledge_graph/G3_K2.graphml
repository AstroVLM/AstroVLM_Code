  <data key="d1">Celestial objects, such as Venus, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter, are targets for astrophotography. They usually require short exposure times and may not need a tracking mount. These objects, which include bodies in our Solar System and other systems, are visible in the sky and can be studied scientifically through astrophotography. They can be used as focus objects, and their apparent magnitude helps in finding and identifying them. The brighter ones are most visible at opposition, and information about them can be obtained from software and the Observer's Handbook. They can be photographed in various astrophotography modes, including video and Camera Only mode time exposures, and slow focal ratio telescopes are optimized for photographing them. Some can be imaged when near the Moon, and they can be photographed with a camera and telescope, each presenting its own characteristics and challenges. Point light - source astronomical objects are observable during astronomical twilight.</data>

  <data key="d0">EXPOSURE TIME</data>
  <data key="d1">In astrophotography, exposure time is a crucial camera parameter that must be chosen correctly and often requires full manual control, especially for DSLRs. It refers to the time the camera's sensor is exposed to light and can be adjusted to achieve different imaging results. The exposure time is affected by various factors such as the camera lens focal length (e.g., when using the Omegon Mini Track LX2 NS), the focal ratio of a telescope, the use of a reducer accessory on a telescope, magnification, Earth's rotation, ISO, and more. For different astronomical objects, specific exposure times are recommended: for the Moon, values like 1/60 or 1/250 of a second; for comets, around 30 seconds; for pre - dawn Earth's shadow, 5 seconds; for sunset, 0.5 seconds. Beginners photographing deep - sky objects (DSOs) should not exceed 5 minutes. When capturing planets with the Moon, especially non - bright ones, the exposure time needs adjustment. It can be estimated using the 500 Rule, and in compact cameras, the manual mode should allow setting different exposure times for astronomical photography. Also, too long an exposure can cause issues like Venus overwhelming the camera sensor.</data>

  <data key="d0">TELESCOPE</data>
  <data key="d1">Telescopes are optical instruments used for astronomical observations and astrophotography. They come in various types (e.g., Schmidt Cassegrain, Newtonian reflector, refractor), apertures, and brands. Telescopes can be used alone or in combination with cameras in different modes such as Camera and Telescope mode, prime focus mode, and eyepiece projection. They are used to view and photograph celestial objects like planets, moons, comets, nebulae, and galaxies. For solar observations and eclipses, approved solar filters are required. Telescopes may need a proper mount, which could be motorized or equatorial, and may require rebalancing, collimation, and cooling. They can be moved using mobile platforms, and some small refractors can be carried on aircraft. Some telescopes can be controlled by smartphones and tablets. Beginners are advised to start with basic equipment, and high - quality optics are needed for advanced astrophotography. Telescopes can be bought or rented, and test - driving before purchase is an option. They also need protection from heat, moisture, and should be properly stored and maintained.</data>

  <data key="d1">The targets of astrophotography include objects such as planets, stars, DSOs, the Sun, and the Moon. Astrophotographers select these targets to photograph, which need to be found, framed, and verified. Astrocameras are used to image these targets, and different cameras, modes, and mounts are recommended or used based on the target type. Photographers also need to consider the camera's resolution according to the target type, and a GOTO mount can be commanded to move towards the target. These targets are more discriminating as to focus than daytime objects, and some cameras may sacrifice performance on a particular class of them.</data>

  <data key="d1">The Sun, the central star of our solar system around which Earth orbits, is a major object of interest in astrophotography. It can be observed and photographed during the day and solar eclipses, but requires proper solar filters, specific procedures, and special safety measures. During solar eclipses, its corona and prominences are visible. Details like sunspots and solar transits can be observed, and it can be photographed in high - resolution records, video astrophotography, and using the afocal method. Slow focal ratio telescopes are optimized for photographing it, and stacking can be used. The ISS can be photographed crossing it with a safe solar filter. It poses a danger during daytime astrophotography and affects the visibility of some planets, and should be kept at a safe distance and out of the field of view during certain astrophotography. As it comes out of the minimum of the current solar cycle, it is expected to be more interesting for astrophotography. It has an apparent magnitude of - 26 and an absolute magnitude of +4.5.</data>

  <data key="d1">In astrophotography, various devices are used to support and position cameras and telescopes. These devices, such as mounts (including alt - az and equatorial mounts), tripods (like carbon fiber tripods with gimbal heads), and other support structures, hold the equipment steady, allow for movement and precise positioning, and are often used with a telescope. Some devices need to be polar - aligned, either during the day for solar or lunar tracking or prior to an eclipse for celestial object tracking. They may require balance adjustment, especially when additional components like the NexYZ, eyepiece, and smartphone are attached, and their axes may need to be locked when attaching a camera to prevent imbalance - related movement. Some devices have a sidereal or solar - tracking rate capability. A quality support device is necessary for advanced astrophotography, and it is often included when buying a telescope, like a decent mount with an SCT or a robust equatorial mount with counterweights and tripod. Users should know how to operate these devices according to the rules and may refer to a corresponding user's manual. These devices may also need protection and a case for storage and transport.</data>

  <data key="d0">FOCAL LENGTH</data>
  <data key="d1">There are several important parameters related to lenses and telescopes. A lens parameter, often measured in millimeters and represented by FL, affects the field of view, magnification, size of the solar or lunar disk in the frame, appearance of the Moon in photographs, and exposure time in Camera Only mode on a fixed tripod. In astrophotography, this lens parameter also impacts the angle of view and has relevant primers. For telescopes, the design (such as CDK and Cassegrain) is related to achieving long focal lengths, while refractors can have various focal lengths. The actual distance from the lens or mirror to the focal point affects the size of the image and the field of view. There is also a parameter used to calculate the power of a telescope - eyepiece combination, which can be adjusted by accessories, and a parameter associated with both the telescope and the eyepiece to calculate the eyepiece's magnification. Overall, these parameters play crucial roles in astrophotography.</data>

Different types of lenses, including wide - angle, normal, telephoto, fisheye, and zoom lenses, with various focal lengths (such as 14 - 300mm, 200 - 500mm, 50mm, etc.) are suitable for different astrophotography scenarios, like photographing the moon, zodiacal light, or during solar eclipses. The lens may require proper support from a mounting, and heavier lenses can impact the mounting selection. It can be an interchangeable accessory, with front and rear caps, and may need to be changed during astronomical activities. For solar eclipse viewing and photography (except during totality), a properly - fitting solar filter from an AAS - recommended dealer is required. The lens should be properly cleaned, cared for, and its compatibility with the camera needs to be checked.

  <data key="d0">STACKING</data>
  <data key="d1">An advanced astrophotography imaging method is a powerful processing tool that stacks and processes multiple video frames into one final image. It uses software to select and stack the best images from many video or single images for better detail, sharpness, and contrast. It is used for handling lunar, planetary, and solar images, is mentioned on multiple pages (e.g., 33, 86) in a book, and currently has no satisfactory programs for Mac OS.</data>

<node id="n1357">
  <data key="d0">EYEPIECE</data>
  <data key="d1">The telescope has various optical components used for astrophotography and visual viewing. There are three basic eyepieces with focal lengths of one inch, half - inch, and quarter - inch, along with a 2x Barlow for magnification. These eyepieces are available in 2 - inch and 1.25 - inch sizes and have different barrel sizes and focal lengths. A lens can be used in combination with the telescope, and the NexYZ can be attached to it with focus adjustment required. It is also used in the afocal method of astrophotography, where the camera is positioned next to it. This optical component, similar to camera lenses in care and cleaning, is part of the telescope's optical system, magnifies the image formed by the telescope, and its magnification is calculated based on its focal length and the telescope's focal length.</data>

  <data key="d1">Magnification is a characteristic of a telescope or an eyepiece - telescope combination. It is calculated by dividing the focal length of the telescope by the focal length of the eyepiece. It is a parameter in astronomical observations and astrophotography that affects exposure time, object centering, and the image. It is also related to the imaging method used and is affected by the use of an extender/barlow accessory on a telescope, and it is related to the ability to enlarge the image of an object.</data>
